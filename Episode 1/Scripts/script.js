//They are used usually when a developer wants to describe parts of their code.
//Single line comments start with the " // " symbols and only include whats after them on the same line
//Multi line comments start with " /* " and end with " */ ". They include everything in between them.

"console.log()" will take "any" kind of data type.

--------------------------------------------------

There are different kinds of data types,
for now all we need to know is: 

• Strings: this is just simple text. The computer understands you want a
           string only when you put it between "speechmarks"

• Intergers: An integer is a whole number (not a fraction / no decimals) that can be 
             positive, negative, or zero.
